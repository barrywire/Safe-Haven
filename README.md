# Safe-Haven
## Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="40px">

Bob has some little financial troubles. He borrows a bit too much than he makes. This means that he is almost always in debt. He doesn't know that this is why he drinks a bit too much, and pushes his friends away. 

Pope is not like Bob, he has his financial life together, because he works a bit too much than he rests. He does not know that this is the reason why he has poor relations with his friends and family, why his young kids who have now grown are growing distant as the days go by.

Matt has a great social life. I mean, it is expected for him as a popular DJ. However, he lost most of his streams of income due to the pandemic. He thinks that life is going great but he is not being true to himself and those around him.

Victor on the other hand is not like any of these guys. He does not make as much as any of them, he does not have as many friends. However, he gives time to listen to himself, to draw this map of his decisions and how he thinks they have affected him. He keeps his mental closet empty.

Safe Haven is a safe space for Bob, Pope and Matt. They can share their experiences, anonymously ofcouse, and get professional psychiatric advice before we lost any of them to self-induced early graves. 

### Give attention to your mental space.
Do not be like Bob, Pope and Matt who are oblivious. Be like Victor. Clean your Closet. 

Visit Safe Haven, join others on the journey to clean closets. Let us get to the end of our lives alive.
